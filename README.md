# TextCapture App Documentation

## Overview
The **TextCapture App** is a Python-based tool designed to capture and summarize text, supporting both Latvian and English. This app leverages text processing, OCR, and translation capabilities to provide users with concise summaries of their input, either in the original or translated language. It features a Flask API for easy interaction, making it accessible for integration into larger systems.

## Key Features
- **Multilingual Summarization**: Supports text summarization in both Latvian and English.
- **OCR Capability**: Extracts text from images using Tesseract OCR for summarization.
- **API-Based**: Utilizes a Flask API, allowing users to interact with the app programmatically.
- **Translation Support**: Translates text between Latvian and English using the `translate` library.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following before installation:

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Tesseract OCR**: Installed on your system and accessible. Refer to [Tesseract installation](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) for setup instructions.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
Start by downloading the source code from the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuceneX/TextCapture.git
cd TextCapture
```
####Install Dependencies
Run the following to set up a virtual environment and install the required libraries.
```
python -m venv venv
```
```
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
###Start the Flask Server
Start the Flask server by running the following:
```
python app.py
```
By default, the Flask server will start on localhost:5000. You can change the port in the app.py file if needed.

###Deactivate Flask Server
To stop the Flask server, simply press CTRL+C. Then, to deactivate the virtual environment:
```
deactivate
```
You can now close the terminal.

##API Usage

The app is built as an API with Flask, and the main endpoints include options to upload text, images, or specify language preferences for summarization.

###Sample API Endpoints
```
Summarize Text: POST /summarize
```
Request Body: JSON with text, language, and summarize parameters.
Response: Summarized text in the specified language.
```
OCR and Summarize: POST /ocr
```
Request Body: Upload an image file (PNG, JPEG).
Response: Text summary extracted from the image.
For testing purposes, test_api.py provides examples of API calls and can be executed to verify the functionality of each endpoint.

###Example Requests

Summarize Text in English:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/summarize -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Input text here", "language": "en", "summarize": true}'
```
OCR and Summarize Image Text:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/ocr -F "file=@/path/to/image.png"
```
##Troubleshooting

Tesseract Not Found:
If OCR fails, ensure Tesseract is installed and accessible in your systemâ€™s PATH.

CORS Issues:
If accessing the API from a browser, check flask-cors settings in app.py to ensure the correct configuration.

##Future Enhancements

GUI Option: Add a graphical interface for easier use.
Expanded Language Support: Integrate additional languages for wider usability.
Advanced Summarization Models: Leverage transformer-based models for improved summarization quality.
